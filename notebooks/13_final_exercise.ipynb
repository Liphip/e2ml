    "# Final Excercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will find the last exercise of the lecture:\n",
    "You are handed an initial dataset with several features and a univariate target. Next, you have to decide how to proceed. Since you do not have enough data to yet construct a classifier/predictor of any sensible evaluation metrics, the first task is, therefore, to acquire more data. For this purpose you can obtain batches of data according to your own design of experiments, so you will need to decide which experiments you consider necessary to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have four opportunities to acquire more data. Each time you have to decide which experiments to run and send those to Franz Götz-Hahn as a CSV file. The deadlines are 16.06.2023, 23.06.2023, 30.06.2023, and 07.07.2023 and 12:00 (noon). The format in all cases is a table with one row for each choosable feature, and the column entries corresponding to the desired values. Each individual sample will take approximately 30min, so pick a reasonable amount of experiments. For example, you will get the result for 100 experiments roughly 50 hours after the respective deadline. Should the experiment not be conductible, you will get a ``None`` as a result, e.g., if a feature value is out of range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your data, you should compare the performance of different classifiers in predicting the targets. The classifiers to compare are [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), [SVC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC), and [MLPClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html). You should utilize all the different parts of the E2ML lecture that you considern appropriate. This could include Data Preprocessing, Design of Experiments for the batches, deciding on Performance Measures, Statistical Significance Testing of a hypothesis, Design of Experiments for Hyperparameter Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you wish to present the results from this excercise in the oral examination, you need to hand in your entire package until 14.07.2023-23:59 as a GitHub Repository. Send the link to the (public) repository to Franz Götz-Hahn via [E-Mail](mailto:franz.goetz-hahn@uni-kassel.de). Please use the README of the repository to describe the structure of the package, include any required packages in the setup.py, add the data in the data subfolder, save any results in the results subfolder, and include a _descriptive_ jupyter notebook in the notebooks subfolder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do note, that the point of this excercise is **not** to achieve the best performance of your models, but rather to document your process and give the motivation behind your chosen approaches, _even the ones that failed_."
