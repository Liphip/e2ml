    "Now, we will implement the Halton sequence as a **space filling** technique for experimental design. \n",

    "\n",
    "A Halton sequence is a low-discrepancy sequence with the property that for all values of $N$, its subsequence $\\mathbf{x}_1, ..., \\mathbf{x}_N$ has a low **discrepancy**. Roughly said, a low discrepancy is a kind of criterion to express the fact that a sequence fills a segment, leaving no gaps. Low-discrepancy sequences are also called quasirandom sequences, due to their common use as a replacement of uniformly distributed random numbers. The *quasi* modifier is used to denote more clearly that the values of a low-discrepancy sequence are neither random nor pseudorandom. Still, such sequences share some properties of random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quasirandom numbers have an advantage over pure random numbers in that they cover the domain of interest quickly and evenly. They have an advantage over purely deterministic methods because they only give high accuracy when the number of conditions is preset. In contrast, using quasirandom sequences improves the accuracy as more conditions are added, with full reuse of the existing points. On the other hand, quasirandom point sets can have a significantly lower discrepancy for a given number of points than purely random sequences.\n",
